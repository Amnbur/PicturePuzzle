Its a simple Picture Puzzle game.  
What makes it a little different is that it is going to allow the gamer to move multiple pieces in one step, and there will be extra space for the gamer to place pieces temporarily.

## Move Several Pieces  

To move pieces. use the `left_ctrl` key to select them. Note that the positions of these pieces before and after movement should not overlap. This is forbidden because it may cause something unwanted.

## Command Line  

```cmd
PicturePuzzle [imgPath] [xSize] [ySize]
```

arguments with "[]" are optional  
skim `StartGame.cmd` as an example

## Use Another Background image  

To use another picture or change level, edit ` StartGame.cmd` and start the game with this script.  
Of course other pictures can be used if you configure it in the same way.

Extra space:  this part not done yet.
